    <h1>Hello guys!!</h1>
    <p>People perceive dogs to be gentler and friendlier than cats; this is due to their genetic nature, which causes
        dogs to be humble and cats to be overwhelmed. Cats have mood swings and adjust accordingly, but dogs are very
        gentle; they accept you for who you are, how you live, and how they look for them.
